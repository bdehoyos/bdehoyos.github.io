title: About Me
---

My name is Bruno De Hoyos and I am a graduate from The University of Texas at Austin. I received my Bachelor of Science in <b>mechanical engineering</b> in May 2016. I enjoy taking things apart and learning how they work, as well as working on small programming projects from time to time.

If you find anything on this site interesting or have any questions, feel free to drop me a message at the comment section below each project page.
