My name is Bruno De Hoyos and I am a third year student at The University of Texas at Austin. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in <b>mechanical engineering</b>, and hope to graduate in the 2016 spring semester. I enjoy taking things apart and learning how they work, as well as working on small programming projects to entertain myself during the weekends.
